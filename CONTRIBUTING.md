# Contributing

:tada::clinking_glasses:  First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::clinking_glasses:

Contributions are always welcome, no matter how small.

The following is a small set of guidelines for how to contribute to the project

## Where to start

### Code of Conduct
This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating you are expected to adhere to these expectations. Please report unacceptable behaviour to [dano@neurotechx.com](mailto:dano@neurotechx.com)

### Contributing on Github

If you're new to Git and want to learn how to fork this repo, make your own additions, and include those additions in the master version of this project, check out this [great tutorial](http://blog.davidecoppola.com/2016/11/howto-contribute-to-open-source-project-on-github/).

### Community

This project is maintained by the [NeuroTechX](www.neurotechx.com) community. Join our Slack to check out our #interactive-tutorial channel, where discussions about EEG101 take place.

## How can I contribute?

This is currently a small, humble project so our contribution process is rather casual. Take a look at our [GitHub Projects board to see](https://github.com/NeuroTechX/eeg-101/projects) to see all the features we are currently working on. If there's a feature you'd be interested in building, go ahead! Let us know on the #interactive-tutorial channel on [the NeuroTechX Slack](http://neurotechx.herokuapp.com/) and we'll support you as much as we can. When you're finished submit a pull request to the master branch referencing the specific issue you addressed.

If you find a bug, or have a suggestion on how to improve the project, just fill out a Github issue!

If you're in the Toronto area, the NeuroTechTO community often gets together to work on EEG 101 and other cool neurotech projects :beers: :pizza:. The NeuroTechX Slack channel is a good place to stay aware of such things, as is the NeuroTechTO newsletter, which you can sign up for [here](http://eepurl.com/cQssYz)
