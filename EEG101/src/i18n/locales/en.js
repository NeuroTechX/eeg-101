	whatIsEEGTitle:  'What exactly is EEG?',
	whatIsEEGDescription:  'Electroencephalography (EEG) is a technique that measures the electrical activity of the brain with sensors that record fluctuations in voltage at the surface of the skull. The first human electroencephalogram was recorded in 1924 by Hans Berger, a German psychiatrist whose interest in ‘psychic energy’ led him to experiment with the electrical fields of the brain.',
	noiseTitle:  'Noise',
	noiseDescription:  'Movement of the eyes (which are electrically charged) and muscle activity produce electrical activity. Thus, blinking, swallowing, and clenching the jaw will all produce noise that can overpower signals originating in the brain. This can make it very difficult to read the EEG. To accurately sense the activity of the brain, movement must be kept to a minimum.',
	cannotReadMindsTitle:  'EEG cannot read minds',
	cannotReadMindsDescription:  'The EEG signal is generated when tens of thousands of brain cells fire in synchrony. Although thinking about a cat produces some change in brain activity, it is too small to affect the large-scale, rhythmic firing of the brain that EEG detects.',
	eyeRythymsTitle:  'Closed eye rhythms',
	eyeRythymsDescription:  'When the eyes are closed, there is often a large increase in rhythmic brain activity in the range of 8-13 cycles per second (Hz). These alpha waves were one of the first discoveries that Hans Berger made with EEG. The ability to detect alpha waves when the eyes are closed varies greatly from person to person, however. Don\'t feel bad if you can\'t see them!',

	neuralBasisEEGTitle:  'Neural basis of EEG.',
	neuralBasisEEGDescription1:  'When synapses are activated on a neuron\'s dendrites, a small electric field (dipole) is created along the body of the neuron due to the difference in charge between those dendrites and the axon. This electric field only lasts for a few milliseconds.',
	neuralBasisEEGDescription2:  'The electric fields produced by single neurons are vanishingly small. However, when large numbers of cortical neurons fire rhythmically, their activity can produce electric fields that are large enough to cross the surface of the skull. This process is influenced by many factors, including depth, orientation, and subtype of neurons, and is a topic of ongoing research.',
	brainStatesTitle:  'Brain states.',
	brainStatesDescription:  'During sleep our brains produce very different kinds of rhythmic electrical activity. When awake, brain rhythms tend to be rapidly-changing and irregular, while slowly-changing, organized rhythms become more dominant as we fall asleep and pass through the multiple sleep stages. {"\n"}Certain emotions and cognitive processes have also been linked with characteristic patterns of rhythmic activity that can be identified with EEG.',

	electrodeNamingDescription:  'EEG electrodes are typically identified by a combination of a letter and a number. The letter indicates the part of the head where the electrode is located (F for frontal, C for central, etc.).

Filters are normally either high-pass (removing low frequencies), low-pass (removing high frequencies) or band-pass (allowing only a specific band of frequencies through). Here, we have implemented a band-pass filter that removes frequencies outside the range of those typically produced by the brain.',
