## Permissions
EEG 101 asks for the following permissions:
- Internet
- Bluetooth
- Bluetooth_admin
- Access Coarse Location
- Write External Storage

We do not track any user data whatsoever. Neither do we mess with our user's phones. We request all of the above permissions simply so that we can implement all the various features of the app (Bluetooth connectivity requires quite a few).
