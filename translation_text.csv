BCIDescription,"A Brain-Computer Interface is a direct communication channel between the brain and an external device. For example, one can feed information about brain state based on EEG frequency bands to a computer; that computer then analyzes the EEG data and decides what the user intent was. The computer can use that command to control an external device such as a wheelchair or a display.","A Brain-Computer Interface is a direct communication channel between the brain and an external device.
